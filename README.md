# House Pricing Prediction
> Find out the import predictor variables affecting the House pricing (Using Advanced Regression).

## Problem Statetment
A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market. The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price. For the same purpose, the company has collected a data set from the sale of houses in Australia

* Which variables are significant in predicting the house price..

* How well those variables describe the price of house

You are required to build a regression model using regularisation in order to predict the actual value of the prospective properties and decide whether to invest in them or not.You are required to model the price of house with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features. They can accordingly manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the demand dynamics of a new market.
